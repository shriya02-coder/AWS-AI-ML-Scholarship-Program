Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, each of the three model architectures classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, each of the three model architectures classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed as they did for Dog_02.jpg.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: No, the three model architectures did not misclassify Animal_Name_01.jpg as a non-dog. They correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg as a dog and correctly classified Object_Name_01.jpg as not a dog.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The Resnet and Alexnet model architectures performed the best since both provided the same correct outputs within equal time resources. The most efficient model algorithm is one that achieves correct classifications while using fewer time resources. The VGG model architecture took longer runtime, which made it less efficient in this context.
